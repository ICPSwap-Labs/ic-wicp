# IC-Wrapped ICP(WICP)

Wrapped ICP(WICP) is the wrapped token of ICP, the native token of the Internet Computer network. It has backed 1:1 with ICP and the same value by way of Canister's full control over ICP!
WICP uses the EXT fungible token standard to allow interoperability between DApps and other tokens. Moreover, integrate ICP with DeFi to solve the problem of ICP's lack of approval function.

## Interacting with Wrapped ICP (WICP) - On Mainnet (DFX)

In order to interact with the Internet Computer mainnet version of the Wrapped ICP (WICP) canister, you need the address.

- WICP Canister ID: `5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai`
- WICP Account ID: `e994ad0378bb902896b55dd5a69a72e7fb2762bba50b32f66f77d2d99d07ac94`

You have to use this address (Canister ID) to make your calls, with the exception of the Account ID during the mint.

### Deposit ICP to mint an WICP balance - mint

#### In command

Using the mint method is done in two steps. First, we need to make a transfer call at the ICP ledger to the WICP account ID. Using the following command you’ll be returned the block height when your transaction was approved.

```bash
dfx ledger --network ic transfer "e994ad0378bb902896b55dd5a69a72e7fb2762bba50b32f66f77d2d99d07ac94" --amount value --memo 0
```

Now that we have the blockHeight of our ICP transfer, we can call the mint method on the WICP canister.

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai mint '(record {to=variant {principal=principal "yourPrincipalId"}; blockHeight=yourBlockHeight:nat64})'
```
```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai mint '(record {to=variant {address="yourAccountId"}; blockHeight=yourBlockHeight:nat64})'
```

#### In Website

Open ICPSwap 1.0 and come to the Wrap page. For example, enter 0.1 as follows, then click the "Wrap" button.

### Unwrap your WICP and regain a balance of ICP - withdraw

Calling withdraw unwraps your WICP, burns it, and then unlocks and sends ICP from the WICP canister to the balance of the Principal ID you specify.

#### In command

The Withdraw method takes two parameters, ‘amount’ and ‘to’. Amount is an integer that represents the amount of WICP you’d like to withdraw to ICP. To is a string that should be the Principal ID or Account ID that you wish the ICP to be transferred to.

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai withdraw '(record {to=variant {principal=principal "yourPrincipalId"}; amount=value:nat})'
```
```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai withdraw '(record {to=variant {address="yourAccountId"}; amount=value:nat})'
```

#### In Website

the Unwarp feature is to restore the WICP to ICP, click the button as shown, exchange the WICP and ICP location, enter the WICP amount, and click the "Unwrap" button.

### Transfer WICP to Another WICP Balance - transfer

You can transfer WICP to any other valid Account. Your balance at the WICP ledger will be deducted and the Account you transfer to, will be incremented.

#### In Command

Transfers ‘value’ (Nat) amount of tokens to user ‘to’ (Principal or Account), returns a TransferResponse which contains the transfer amount or an error message.

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai transfer '(record {to=variant {principal=principal "toPrincipalId"}; token="WICP"; notify=false; from=variant {principal=principal "yourPrincipalId"}; memo=vec {}; subaccount=null; nonce=1; amount=value})'
```
```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai transfer '(record {to=variant {address="toAddress"}; token="WICP"; notify=false; from=variant {address="yourAddress"}; memo=vec {}; subaccount=null; nonce=1; amount=value})'
```

#### In Website

Open ICPSwap 1.0 and come to the Wallet page. Click the Token tab, then you will find the token list. Click the transfer button of WICP, input the Account and Amount in the new window.

### Set an Allowance to Another Identity - approve

You can set an allowance using this method, giving a third-party access to a specific number of tokens they can withdraw from your balance if they want.

An allowance permits the ‘spender’ (Principal) to withdraw tokens from your account or your subAccount, up to the ‘value’ (Nat) amount. If it is called again it overwrites the current allowance with ‘value’ (Nat). There is no upper limit for value, you can approve a larger value than you have, but 3rd parties are still bound by the upper limit of your account balance.

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai approve '(record {subaccount=null; allowance=value; spender=principal "toPrincipalId"})'
```

---

### Transfer WICP on Another User's Behalf - transferFrom

Transfers ‘value’ (Nat) amount of tokens from user ‘from’ (Principal or Acount) to user ‘to’ (Principal or Account), this method allows canister smart contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf, it returns a TransferResponse which contains the transfer amount or an error message.

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai transferFrom '(record {to=variant {principal=principal "toPrincipalId"}; token="WICP"; notify=false; from=variant {principal=principal "yourPrincipalId"}; memo=vec {}; subaccount=null; nonce=1; amount=value})'
```
```bash
dfx canister --network=ic call 5xnja-6aaaa-aaaan-qad4a-cai transferFrom '(record {to=variant {address="toAddress"}; token="WICP"; notify=false; from=variant {address="yourAddress"}; memo=vec {}; subaccount=null; nonce=1; amount=value})'
